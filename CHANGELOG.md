#### Disclosures
MoPub v4.16 SDK integrates technology from our partners Integral Ad Science, Inc. (“IAS”) and Moat, Inc. (“Moat”) in order to support viewability measurement and other proprietary reporting that [IAS](https://integralads.com/capabilities/viewability/) and [Moat](https://moat.com/analytics) provide to their advertiser and publisher clients. You have the option to remove or disable this technology by following the [opt-out instructions](#disableViewability) below.  

If you do not remove or disable IAS's and/or Moat’s technology in accordance with these instructions, you agree that IAS's [privacy policy](https://integralads.com/privacy-policy/) and [license](https://integralads.com/sdk-license-agreement) and Moat’s [privacy policy](https://moat.com/privacy),  [terms](https://moat.com/terms), and [license](https://moat.com/sdklicense.txt), respectively, apply to your integration of these partners' technologies into your application.

#### <a name="disableViewability"></a>Disabling Viewability Measurement
There are a few options for opting out of viewability measurement:  
##### Strip out from JCenter Integration
Normally, to add the MoPub SDK to your app via JCenter, your `build.gradle` would contain:

```	
dependencies {
	compile('com.mopub:mopub-sdk:4.16.0@aar') {
		transitive = true
	}
}
```
Update to the following to exclude one or both viewability vendors:

```
dependencies {
	compile('com.mopub:mopub-sdk:4.16.0@aar') {
		transitive = true
		exclude module: 'libAvid-mopub' // To exclude AVID
		exclude module: 'moat-mobile-app-kit' // To exclude Moat
    }
}
```
##### Strip out from GitHub integration
Navigate to the `gradle.properties` file in your home directory (e.g. `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`) and include one or both of these lines to opt out of viewability measurement for AVID and/or Moat.  

```
mopub.avidEnabled=false
mopub.moatEnabled=false
```
##### Disable via API
If you would like to opt out of viewability measurement but do not want to modify the MoPub SDK, a function is provided for your convenience. At any point, call `MoPub.disableViewability(vendor);`. This method can can be called with any of the enum values available in `ExternalViewabilitySessionManager.ViewabilityVendor`: `AVID` will disable AVID but leave Moat enabled, `MOAT` will disable Moat but leave AVID enabled, and `ALL` will disable all viewability measurement.

**Native Ads Changes**
 - `MoPubNativeAdRenderer` has been replaced by `MoPubStaticNativeRenderer` 
 - When requesting ads using `MoPubNative`, you must instantiate and register a `MoPubStaticNativeAdRenderer`. See the [Integration Document](https://developers.mopub.com/docs/android/native/#method-3-manual-integration) for more details.
 - `NativeResponse` has been replaced with `NativeAd`
 - `NativeAd` has a new API that supports creating and rendering `View`s for Native Ads.
   - `#createAdView` returns a `View` that can hold data for the `NativeAd`
   - `#renderAdView` will populate the `View` with ad data.

  Provided Custom Events for Facebook Banners, Interstitials and Native Ads (included
  in the extras/ folder) are now compatible with the latest SDK release from Facebook (3.18.1).
  - **Updated API for Native Ads Custom Event writers**
  If you are mediating Facebook or InMobi native ads, this change requires you to copy
  FacebookNative.java and InMobiNative.java custom events from the extras/ folder to
  com.mopub.nativeads package for compatibility.

## Version 3.0.0 (September 30, 2014)

  - **Location Settings are now SDK-wide**
    - Calls to `MoPubView#setLocationAwareness` and `MoPubInterstial#setLocationAwareness` are
    deprecated in favor of `MoPub#setLocationAwareness`
    - Calls to `MoPubView#setLocationPrecision` and `MoPubInterstitial#setLocationPrecision` are
    deprecated in favor of `MoPub#setLocationPrecision`
    - Calls to any of these methods have the effect of setting location awareness and precision
    globally for the SDK
  - **Build target SDK is now API Level 19.** If you are building the MoPub SDK from source,
  modify your dependencies to reference Android 4.4.2, API Level 19. This does not affect the
  minimum device API level, which remains at API Level 9.
  - **Source-level support for Gradle projects.** The SDK source now includes a build.gradle file you can use to build source as part of your Gradle project.
  - **The SDK now uses Play Services 5.0.89**

  - **Simplified APIs for inserting native ads.** See [Native Ads Integration](https://developers.mopub.com/docs/android/native/) for details.
  - **Automatic ad caching for smooth scrolling.** For native ads, the SDK will now automatically pre-load ads, resulting in smoother scrolling.
  - **Performance improvements** The SDK now makes more efficient use of memory for image caching and avoids allocating temporary objects while scrolling, resulting in fewer garbage collections.
  - **Sample app improvements.** An improved sample app allows saving ad unit IDs for testing.
  - **Bug fixes:**
    - Banner auto-refresh is now properly re-enabled when resuming your app.

## Version 2.3 (July 17, 2014)

  - **Improved impression tracking for Native Ads** Impression tracking for native ads is now more accurate and more efficient.
  - **Streamlined Maven Build and Dependencies** MoPub's Android SDK now depends on the Android v4 Support Library shipped with the Android Build tools. The MoPub Sample App also depends on Google Play Services to use the Android Advertising ID. We recommend building against Play Services in your app as well. For integration instructions, see the [getting started page](https://developers.mopub.com/docs/android/getting-started/).
  - **Removed AdMob Custom Events and JAR** AdMob's SDK is deprecated by Google and the APIs have been moved to Google Play Services. Existing AdMob adunits will now invoke the appropriate Google Play Services custom event. Developers must update their integration to use the Google Play Services custom events located in the extras folder by August 1.
  - **Updated Third-Party Network Compatibility** MoPub's provided Custom Events (included in the extras/ folder) are now compatible with the latest SDK releases from Millennial Media (5.3.0), Vungle (3.1.0), InMobi (4.4.1) and Google Play Services (5.0.77).
  - Fixed intermittent NullPointerException in MoPubNative#requestNativeAd; fixes [Github issue #97] (https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/issues/97)

## Version 2.2 (June 19, 2014)

  - **Native ads mediation** release; integration instructions and documentation are available on our [help page](https://developers.mopub.com/docs/android/integrating-networks/). Added custom event native implementations to the native extras directory of the SDK (`/extras/src/com/mopub/nativeads`), with initial support for the following networks:
  	- Facebook Audience Network (`FacebookNative.java`)
  	- InMobi Native Ads (`InMobiNative.java`)
  - **Native ads content filtering**: Added the ability to specify which native ad elements you want to receive from the MoPub Marketplace to optimize bandwidth use and download only required assets, via `RequestParameters.Builder#desiredAssets(…)`. This feature only works for the six standard Marketplace assets, found in `RequestParameters.NativeAdAsset`. Any additional elements added in direct sold ads will always be sent down in the extras.
  - Added star rating information to the `NativeResponse` object, via `NativeResponse#getStarRating()`. This method returns a `Double` corresponding to an app's rating on a 5-star scale.
  - VAST video quartile and completion trackers now always include the user-agent
  - Ensured that banners never autorefresh until they have been loaded at least once

## Version 2.1 (May 15, 2014)

  - Added custom events for Facebook ads. `FacebookBanner` and `FacebookInterstitial` can be found in the extras directory of the SDK (`/extras/src/com/mopub/mobileads`).

  - Fixed cases where VAST Video Interstitials were failing to fire `InterstitialAdListener` callbacks; fixes [GitHub issue #78](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/issues/78)
  - Simplified click tracking logic for HTML ads

## Version 2.0 (April 22, 2014)

  - **Native Ads** public release; integration instructions and documentation available on our [support website](https://developers.mopub.com/docs/android/native/)
  - Changed minimum supported Android version to Froyo (Android 2.2, API level 8)
  - Added support for Google Play Services advertising identifier
  - Renamed the `com.mopub.mobileads.MraidBrowser` Activity to `com.mopub.common.MoPubBrowser`.
      - **Important Note:** This change requires a modification to the `AndroidManifest`. The updated set of requisite activity permissions are as follows:

      	```
    <activity android:name="com.mopub.common.MoPubBrowser"
				android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation"/>
    <activity android:name="com.mopub.mobileads.MoPubActivity"
                android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation"/>
    <activity android:name="com.mopub.mobileads.MraidActivity"
                android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation"/>
	<activity android:name="com.mopub.mobileads.MraidVideoPlayerActivity"
                android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation"/>
		```
  - Upgraded the bundled `android-support-v4` library to r19.1.
      - **Note for Maven users:** Newer versions of the `android-support-v4` artifact are unavailable on Maven central, so we have included a small script to update the version in your local artifact repository. Please navigate to the `mopub-sdk` directory, and run `scripts/mavenize_support_library`.

## Version 1.15 (August 21, 2013)

Includes support for ads in the MRAID 2.0 format. MRAID 2.0 allows advertisers to create ads with rich media functionality, including adding calendar events, storing pictures and playing videos in the native video player. To learn more about MRAID 2.0, read our [help article](https://developers.mopub.com/docs/ad-formats/mraid/).

  - Added the following MRAID 2.0 features: `createCalendarEvent` (Android 4.0 and above), `playVideo`, `storePicture`, and `supports`
  - Hardware Acceleration is now enabled by default for `MraidInterstitial`s on Android 4.0 and above

To correctly display ads that ask the user to save a picture (storePicture ads), you need to make the following change to AndroidManifest.xml:
* Add the`WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission. Note: **Adding the permission is optional**. If the permission is not added, we will not deliver any store picture ads to the users' devices. All other features will remain functional without the new permission.

To allow users to play videos using the native video player:
* Declare activity `com.mopub.mobileads.MraidVideoPlayerActivity`. This activity is required to support playing videos in the native player and we strongly recommend adding it.
